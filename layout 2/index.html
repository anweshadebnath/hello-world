            <p class="text">Nonte Phonte (Bengali: নন্টে-ফন্টে), also spelled as Nonte Fonte, is a Bengali comic-strip (and later comic book) creation of Narayan Debnath which originally was serialized for the children's monthly magazine Kishore Bharati (Bengali: কিশোর ভারতী). The stories featuring in the comic strips focusses on the trivial lives of the title characters, Nonte and Phonte, along with a school-senior, Keltuda, and their Hostel Superintendent. The comics have appeared in book form and have been recreated since 2003 in colour. A popular animation series based on the characters has also been filmed.</p>
